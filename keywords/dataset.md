## Dataset

A dataset is essentially a structured collection of data which can be tabular or non-tabular. Four features of datasets include grouping, content, relatedness, and purpose. In this sense, the data is represented as a collective unit or a set of numbers, where addition/subtraction doesn't change the sets identity, for observing and related by time, place, instrument, or object of observation. [^Renear]. Tabular data is oragnized by rows and columns, whereas non-tablular data is unorganized with brackets. Datasets can be categorized by information, such as numerical, bivariate, mulitvariate, categorical, and correlational data  [^IBM]. Data is important for making decisions, making it valuble for making decisions regarding consumerism and science [^Renear]. 

In conclusion, datasets are overall very valuble for data analaysis, in making decisions, and optimizing resources. [^Chapman]. Large datasets are essential for machine learning and algorithms [^IBM Support" 2021], valuble to companies, and overall analyzing data.
