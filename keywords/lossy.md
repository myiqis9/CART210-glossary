## Lossy
Lossy is when there is a loss in data or information. Lossy compression discards as much data as possible in order to make a file smaller. This is done by targeting data that is less noticeable to the human eye.[^brookes2021lossy] When compressing a file, there will be a distortion in the reconstruction of the file. Lossy compression occurs when the decompressed data is not the same as before the compression occurred.[^shukla2011lossy] 

For example, JPEG is a lossy compression because the compression does affect the quality of the image.[^shukla2011lossy]
Techniques used are called color space and Chroma subsampling. Color space reduction is when we reduce the color pixels to the most common colors found in the image. Chroma subsampling refers to when we are averaging or dropping some of the chrominance information in the image. This is because human eyes and perception are able to detect changes in brightness more sharply than color. [^lu2016lossy]

Because we live in a digital era, lossy compression has its advantages in making it easier for us to send files and prioritizing / synthesizing the essential information. But it is worth noting that the more compressed a file is the more the quality of the image or sound will suffer.
