## Lossless
Lossless is when there is no loss in data. When compressing a file, we want to store fewer bits all while preserving the original content [^brookes2021lossless], this is so that data is easier to store or transmit more efficiently[^lu2016lossless]. Lossless compression occurs when the decompressed data is the same as before the compression occurred and there is no loss of information during reconstruction[^brookes2021lossless]. For example, PNG is a lossless compression [^brian2022lossless] because the compression does not affect the quality of the image.

Techniques used are called dictionary code and run length encoding. Run length encoding is where redundant data is represented differently to save space. For example, if an image contains 7 yellow pixels instead of storing each yellow pixel 7 time it would be better to say there 7 yellow pixels and would only need to mention that there a yellow pixel one time.[^crashcourse2017lossless]

In our contemporary world, lossless compression is important because we live in a digital era, where more often than not we are constantly sharing information online to our friends, peers and colleagues. Whether it’s images or text files, lossless compression plays a crucial role since it important to be able to send out information quickly and efficiently without losing any of that data.
