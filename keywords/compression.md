## Compression
Compression (or in this case Data Compression) is a process that computers[link] have for a multitude of reasons but mainly to reduce the size of digital files.[^adobecompression] There are many types of compression; image compression, audio compression, and file compression just to name a few. For all of the previously stated, they can either have [lossy](../main/glossary.md#lossy) or [lossless](../main/glossary.md#lossless) compression. 

The main idea of compression is for the selected file to have more effective density and be able to communicate the information internally more easily (for example, open a file more easily or transfer the file around the computer).[^lelewer97compression] Data compression is extremely important for the effectiveness of a computer because of reasons such as less space taken in the storage which means the file will use less RAM (memory) when opening.[^tuteja04compression]
