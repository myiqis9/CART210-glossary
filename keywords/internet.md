## Internet

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that enables individuals around the world to communicate and exchange information. [^Zare24internet1] 

The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven. The word Internet was used in 1945 by the United States War Department in a radio operator's manual, and in 1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork. Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks.[^Zare24internet2] 
The term internet (or internetwork) is simply a contraction of the phrase inter-network. However, when written with a capital "I," the Internet refers to a global network of interconnected systems. [^Zare24internet3]

The Internet functions as an interactive medium, linking millions of devices and people. It facilitates data transmission, communication across several platforms, and access to a wide range of information. The Internet is naturally interactive, allowing computer users to communicate across networks. [^Zare24internet4] 

The Internet has empowered ordinary citizens by making it easier for them to produce and distribute information to a variety of audiences. This transformation has caused a fundamental shift in the traditional media landscape. [^Zare24internet5]
