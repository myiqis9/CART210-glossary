## Fan/Fandom

A Fan is a person that devotes themselves with genuine enthusiasm to something or someone. Whether it be an activity, a person, a product, a group, a company, etc… They can range from people who simply deeply enjoy something to someone who dedicates themselves to something they enjoy to the point of positively advertising it to people who are unaware of it and/or creating content around it.

Originating from the latin term fanaticus, meaning insane, mad, or possessed by gods [^Barton14Fan/Fandom] and the term “fanatic” used to describe extremely devout religious followers, the term was shortened to “fan”, which allowed it to abandon such a religious connotation and the usual intensity that accompanies the term, and then made its way into common English language.

Fans and Fandoms are very known for expressively displaying their love for the material, person, or organization that they are fans of. Fanfiction, which can be described as stories written by fans of mass-produced media [^De_Kosnik16Fan/Fandom], is one of the prime methods fans use to show their affection for storytelling media for example. Fans will analyze the source material, re-structure, re-imagine a written story that they enjoyed and discuss it with others. Fans and fandoms are usually positive minded. But people can also form a community around things they hate. The term anti-fandom/anti-fans describes this as “distant readers who form an image of a text or a genre without actually paying attention to it, and who then viscerally define their identity against the disliked object.”[^Duffett13Fan/Fandom]
