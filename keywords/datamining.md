## Data Mining
Data Mining is when data scientists use big data to find patterns that are novel and/or useful for businesses or individuals who want to learn more in-depth information about data collected. For instance, a data scientist could look at a real estate database containing leases and permits and find out patterns that could predict purchasing patterns for  companies [^Sipes].

Data mining can be particularly useful because you don’t necessarily need to know the question you are asking in order to find answers. Using a top-down approach, data scientists are able to find patterns and create analysis of said patterns without a particular question in mind. This way companies can find ways to identify novel, useful, or understandable correlations and patterns in data sets
without having a particular question in mind. Companies can find answers like correlative purchases (like how men buying diapers often buy beer as well [^Chung]) or new patterns (who will repay a loan).
