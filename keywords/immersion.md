## Immersion

Immersion refers to the state of being deeply engaged or absorbed in an activity or environment to the extent where one loses awareness of the outside world. It involves a complete focus on the present moment which often leads to a flow state where time seems to pass quickly.[^frances09immersion]

The term "Immersive technology" refers to technologies that merge the physical and digital world together. Two examples of this would be [AR](./ar.md) and [VR](./vr.md) which engage the user through a screen and the physical world at the same time.[^ryan99immersion]

Immersion relates equaly to psychology, media studies, and the arts, since it explores how individuals engage with various stimuli and environments. It also intersects with theories of attention, consciousness, and presence, offering insights into human experiences and perceptions.[^wolf17immersion]
