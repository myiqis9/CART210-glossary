## Subversion

Merriam-Webster defines the word "subvert" saying: 
1. "to overturn or overthrow from the foundation"
2. "to pervert or corrupt by an undermining of morals, allegiance, or faith"[^merriam24subvert]

Subversion (from Latin _subvertere_ 'overthrow) originates in political contexts. Subversive activities in the 70s and 80s were those that threatened the safety or well-being of the state or aimed to undermine the government. [^Spjut79Subversion]

I understand subversion as the process or act of undermining or overturning something established, like an institution, authority, or popular set of beliefs. 

In their paper "New Media Poetics as a Strategy for Political Subversion.", Dousos suggests that new digital technologies and consumer products have increased potential to subvert normative power structures, despite their original design not being for this goal. The internet has turned all of us from passive consumers to active producers of content, potentially empowering us to greatly subvert existing social structures. [^Dousos18Subversion]
