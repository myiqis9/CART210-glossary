## SEO (search engine optimization)

SEO (search engine optimization) is a function of enhancing search results in a given internet search engine. It prioritizes ‘natural’ results rather than paid results so as to not give a bias to sites that can pay their way to the top of the list. This is done to prevent biased sources, and instead ensures trust and reliability when using a search engine. This is not only limited to online websites, but also is applied in video, academic, and image searches too.

A common kind of proper application of SEO is viral content. As an example, when searching ‘squid game’ before the netflix show of the same name came out, one would likely find some entertaining videos of squids playing around. But as the show came out and people wanted more information on the show, the SEO algorithm took note and boosted the show’s and relevant content’s rankings much higher. 

When search engines began scraping the web for sites in the mid 1990s, they prioritized key words in the meta tag or index files of the site. This was useful for the time, but many people took note and took advantage by cramming their tags with popular keywords so as to reach higher in the ranks. [^WikiSEO]

This was worked around quickly, since this abuse of SEO might drive away users to other engines. The iteration of SEO is still mainly kept a secret, to prevent more abuse of the system. There are a few things that are well known to not do. As an example, in february of 2011, google updated their engine to penalize sites that had duplicated content. [^oviewSEO] [^SEO]
