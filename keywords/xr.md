## Extended Reality (XR)

Extended Reality (XR) is a term that encompasses augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR). It refers to all real and virtual combined environments and human-machine interactions generated by computer technology and wearables. [^wikipedia23xr]

Extended Reality (XR) refers to the blend of physical and digital environments created through technologies like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR). It encompasses immersive experiences that merge or simulate the real world with digital enhancements, facilitated by advancements in computing and wearable technology. This broad definition captures the essence of XR's aim to enhance human-machine interactions across various domains including entertainment, education, and training, among others. [^Çöltekin20xr]

The article "Exploring the Future of Extended Reality in Higher Education" from EDUCAUSE Review provides insights into the implementation and challenges of XR in educational settings. It discusses the importance of adopting a nimble approach to technology deployment, emphasizes cross-disciplinary work to fully exploit XR's potential, and highlights the significance of community building within and across institutions to foster innovation in XR applications. The discussion includes practical considerations such as the need for educational institutions to be adaptable in their technology investments, to foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and to build communities that support XR development and deployment in education​.[^Pomerantz20xr]
