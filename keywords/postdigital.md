## Post-Digital

The term ‘post-digital’ was introduced by Kim Cascone when he described a trend in digital music in his text “The Aesthetics of Failure: ‘Post-Digital’ Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music”, writing that digital technology had reached everyone in some form or another. [^PostDigitalWiki_1] 
Post-digital refers to the concept or era where the boundaries between the physical world and the digital world become blurred. Post-digital does not refer to the concept of digital technology becoming obsolete, but rather a time where digital technology becomes ubiquitous. [^PostDigitalWiki_2]  An example of this could be the way someone could view their cellphone or smart watch as an extension of their self. This is contrasted by the early days of digital technology and personal electronics, when someone may have had a room set up for their computer, and set aside specific time to use it. The ‘post’ in post-digital should not be understood as a linear progression past digital technology, but rather a cultural shift and evolution of how we perceive it. [^PostDigitalWiki_3]
