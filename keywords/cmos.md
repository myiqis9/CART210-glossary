## CMOS

CMOS (Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor), is a type of transistor that is typically used for IC (integrated circuit) chips like microcontrollers, and memory chips. [^WikiCMOS]

CMOS typically refers to a CMOS chip in a computer motherboard, which holds the BIOS settings of the computer in a RAM chip. This chip mainly consists of interpolation filters, RAM chips, and RAM address buffers. [^layoutCMOS]

This chip needs to be powered by a coin battery, best known as a CMOS battery. Without this battery, the CMOS chip loses power, and loses the BIOS settings as well as the accurate time of the computer. [^WikiCMOSChip]
