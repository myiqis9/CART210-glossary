## UI (User Interface)
### Definition

UI, also known as User Interface, is the human-computer point of contact in any digital device, application, or software [^coursera01ui]. Those points of interaction can include screens, keyboards, computer mice, remote controls, etc., but UI is most commonly referred to in terms of website or software application design [^Churchville02ui]. UI design is all about the communication between the user and the product [^mckay04ui]. 

Contrary to UX (user experience), which is present throughout the entire creation process, UI design specifically focuses interactions between the user and the product [^harris03ui]. UI designers work with navigational elements, input controls, information components, and containers. They design the colors, size, appearance, and overall style of those elements. 


### Differences between UX and UI
| UX                                      | UI                                  |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Entire process of creation              | Focusing on the looks             |
| How does the interaction make them feel | What does the user interact with  |
| Make the purpose of the buttons clear   | Give the buttons an attractive visual |
| User's journey from start to end        | User's interaction with a specific element |
| Easy to use | Easy on the eye

#### Examples
1. Imagine the newest bathrooms at Concordia University where the hand dryer and the faucet are connected in the shape of a T. Now imagine if they were a website. The UI designers did a wonderful job creating a design that seamlessly fits with the rest of the bathroom. It is generally nice to look at. It's usability on the other hand, is lacking. The UX designers failed to take into account that when the dryers turn on, the water in the sink is splashed right back at the user.

### What do they have in common?
UX and UI designers often work together to assure their product's:
- Usability
- Interactivity
- Behavior
- Effortless experience
