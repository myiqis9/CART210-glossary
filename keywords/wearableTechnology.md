## Wearable Technology

Wearable technology - also referred to as 'wearables' - encapsulates all wireless devices incorporated in consumers' everyday accessories and clothing. Although originally referring to items that can be worn (and sequentially, removed), new technological advancements have redefined the term to include more invasive forms of wearable technology, such as implanted microchips and smart tattoos[^ometov21wearableTech]. 

The market for wearable technology is rising exponentially as it allows the seamless incorporation of computers and electronics such as handheld mobile devices into people's lives. Common examples of such technology are tracking bracelets and smartwatches, which utilise sensors to track users' biometrics[^ferreira21wearableTech]. On top of lending improvements to people's everyday lives, they are also useful in numerous other domains, such as health care, fitness, education, finance, and gaming[^wright14wearableTech].

Wearables have developed a 'smartphone-like experience'[^ometov21wearableTech], allowing users to handle 'calls, emails, texts, and many other alerts without even getting the bulky devices out'[^ometov21wearableTech]. As they continue to evolve, industry analyst Walt Maclay argues that they will further absorb our personal lives, 'taking existing wearables such as eyeglasses, watches, hear-ing aids, and jewelry, and enhancing them with sensors'[^wright14wearableTech]. This falls in junction with new media theory, namely the [postdigital](../main/glossary.md#postdigital); The virtualization and digitization of our reality - of our body - through wearable technology. Wearables are a prime instance of technology becoming further abstracted, blurring the lines between what is and isn't machine by incorporating it on (and in) our bodies.
