## Artificial life

Artificial life is a field of research ranging from computer science to biology. Its goal is to simulate various forms of life, in mathematical, computer and/or robotic form. [^Langton89systems] Artificial life thus allows the more in-depth study of the principles of life, its creation and new applications. [^Bedau&Packard94evolution]
