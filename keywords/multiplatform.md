## Multiplatform

In computing, "multiplatform" refers to software capable of running on two or more different hardware platforms. It's also known as cross-platform software, platform-agnostic software, or platform-independent software. [^Zare24multiplatform1]

A "platform" can encompass the type of processor (CPU), other hardware components, or the operating system (OS) on which software operates, or a combination of these factors. [^Zare24multiplatform2]

As new computing platforms emerge, software developers increasingly target multiple platforms to meet the needs of consumers who use various devices for personal and business activities like communication, banking, and shopping. [^Zare24multiplatform3]
For instance, software available for both Windows and Mac desktop environments, or for iOS and Android mobile devices, is considered multiplatform. Similarly, an interpreter, though sharing the same source code, may have runtime engines tailored for different hardware platforms. [^Zare24multiplatform4]

Cross-platform programming involves intentionally writing software to function on multiple platforms. This term can extend to video games which are compatible with various platforms, including PCs, consoles, and smartphones. [^Zare24multiplatform5]
