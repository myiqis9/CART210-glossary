## User
The term "user" originates from the Old French word "user," meaning to employ or make use of, and also from Vulgar Latin "usare," which denotes making use of or taking advantage of something. In addition, the term "user" in the context of computers was invented in 1967.[^etymolineUser] One of the earliest instances of its use in the context of computing can be traced back to the pioneering work at institutions like the Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society.[^StackExchangeWhyCalledUsers]

A user has many definitions, but let’s focus on the concept of an end user within the technology field. An end user is a person who utilizes a product or service such as a computer, [software](../main/glossary.md#software) and many more, without involvement in its production or sell. Therefore, they are often referred to as customers and operators.[^TheStateOfTheArtInEndUser] End users typically have user accounts with usernames and passwords to authenticate themselves within a system.[^Chinel23Whatisuser]

Understanding the needs of customers who utilize the product is important for developing the best product tailored for the intended users. Additionally, gathering input from users through surveys, interviews, and testing can provide valuable feedback. This feedback can help identify areas for improvement and enable the customization of the user experience to better meet the users’ needs.[^Indeed23WhatIsAnEndUser] 

Users play an important role in the context of new media as they interact with technology in various ways, including navigating interfaces, inputting commands, providing data, and receiving outputs. For example, touchscreen devices which are mostly use nowadays, offer operation flexibility, allowing users to navigate vertically or horizontally using one or more fingers or thumbs while accessing different applications. Distinguishing between tablets and smartphones is crucial due to variations in size, weight, and shape, necessitating different design considerations for ergonomic interface design.[^BröhlMertensZiefleUsersMobile] Therefore, user experience ([UX](../main/glossary.md#ux)) and user interface ([UI](../main/glossary.md#ui)) play a crucial role in the success of a product or service.[^IntuitMailchimp24EndUser]
