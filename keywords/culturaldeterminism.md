## Cultural Determinism

Cultural determinism is a conceptual theory stating that the culture in which we are raised determines the basis for our emotions, behaviors, values, and politics. It suggests that cultural and social influence dominate even biological behavior (i.e., firmly on the "nuture" side of the [nature vs nuture debate](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/nature-vs-nurture)). Breaking the theory down into two concepts, culture is the sum of socially shared attitudes, customs, and beliefs that distinguishes one group of people from another; while determinism is a philosophical position whereby an event has conditions that could not be caused by any other means.  [^feenberg10CD] Cultural determinism is oppositionally related to [technological determinism](../main/glossary.md#technological_determinism), which states that technology determines our culture/society. The concept of cultural determinism first began to gain traction with cultural antropologists in the 1930s, in pushback to concepts of biological determinism and eugenics. [^dutton2018] 

Cultural determinism may not be all determinant, however. Often, people feel pressured to follow cultural norms without understanding or recognizing the reasons or pressure for following those norms. As long as the culture’s coercion remains unconscious, there are few opportunities to act outside of those norms. But it’s not entirely unusual for a person to become aware of their cultural coercion, and act in a different way. [^ketner71CD] There is some debate that this resistance to cultural expectations is also a culture-bound decision. According to Dutton, "it has been argued that cultural determinism is philosophically problematic because, if cultural differences are caused by different histories and history is a group's culture in a set period, we have a circular argument that reifies history".
