## Metadata

Metadata is, essentially, data about other data.[^01netsuite] Its purpose is to organize, manage and understand the data it is relating to and to facilitate searching through large amounts of data. In other words, it's a summary of the data it represents, made to be easier to categorize by search engines, machine learning, or algorithms. 

Metadata provides information on data provenance, such as the what, when, where, who, how, which and why of the data.[^02liuram] It can also contain its history and keywords to describe it. Because of this, it's essential for creating and organizing datasets to be unique and easy to parse through within a database.[^03datasoft] It is usually standardized within a database so that it always contains the same consistent information for each data item that is set in stone within its creation. Commonly, metadata can be seen as a library, creating a containment of indexes and bibliographic records of the data within its catalogue.[^04baca]
