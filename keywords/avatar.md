An avatar is a digital entity or body through which a human being can experience the events within a digital world, giving the user a “subject-position within a simulated environment, a vicarious body through which the player can act as an agent in a fictional world.”[^Castronova03avatar] 

The term takes its meaning from Hinduism, deriving from a Sanskrit word for “descent” and used to refer to the incarnations the Hindu god Vishnu on earth.[^Klevjer06avatar] This term has evolved to symbolize the body that we inhabit when visiting a virtual world, and that only exists there.[^Trepte/Reinecke10avatar]

The creation and use of avatars began mostly in entertainment media such as video games or virtual reality where they can be used by players to accomplish several gameplay related actions such as combat or communication.  But with the increasing popularity and accessibility of 3D art and 3D creation software, avatars have also found use in the creation of 3D artwork, from artistic screenshots to sceneries. The design of an avatar can be as grounded or fantastical as the user desires, ranging from human-like characters to fantastic beasts. Alongside this, the ever-increasing computing power and graphical capabilities of modern computers expand the options available in avatar creation, enabling users to create avatars with more and more sophisticated designs and details.
