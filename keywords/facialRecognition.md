## Facial Recognition

Facial recognition is a recognition system that utilizes biometrics to detect, analyze, and recognize faces.[^kaur20facial] The process can be broken down into three technologies: detection, analysis, and recognition. Detection infers the training of an algorithm to recognize faces; The detected faces are then mapped and converted into a “faceprint”.[^klosowski20facial] Finally, and most notably, faceprints are compared to individuals in a database to find their closest match.[^klosowski20facial] Face recognition, defined by the IEEE, is an umbrella term capturing all "related technologies for building a face recognition system," including "face detection, face position, identity recognition, image preprocessing, etc."[^li20facial] It is ultimately a product of the combination of simple image analysis and [pattern recognition](../main/glossary.md#patternrecognition) systems. 

This software can be traced back to the 1960s. A system developed by Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe in which an "unknown face is compared against data points of previously entered pictures."[^klosowski20facial] As computers became more powerful, they began utilizing [neural networks](../main/glossay.md#neural-networks) in the recognition process, resulting in the development of databases of faces. Such algorithms were predominantly trained on white males, thus leading to a higher rate of misidentification amongst BIPOC and female faces.[^klosowski20facial] Furthermore, facial recognition - notably its increasing use by governments - has given rise to security concerns, including the archiving of biometric information and images to build their databases.[^klosowski20facial] Despite these worries, facial recognition has trickled into our day-to-day lives: face ID has become a vital and normalized feature of our mobile devices. Hence, this recognition technology and its increasing presence in our systems contributes to the growth of surveillance capitalism.
