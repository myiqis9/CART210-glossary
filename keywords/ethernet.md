## Ethernet 

Ethernet is a wired network technology that connects computers and other devices within a local area network (LAN) using cables and protocols. It was invented in the early 1970s by Xerox and became a standard in the 1980s. Ethernet operates by using a set of standards and protocols that define how data is transmitted over the network. It has different types and speeds depending on the cable and device used. The most common types of Ethernet cables include twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber optic cables. The most common Ethernet speeds are 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and 10 Gbps, with never standards offering even faster data rates.[^BasuMallick23ethernet]

Ethernet usually offers faster [Internet](../main/glossary.md#internet) connection than Wi-Fi because of its use of cables rather than radio waves which can be less stable and secure.[^BusinessInsider24ethernet]

Ethernet's relevance to new media lies in its ability to provide a stable and high-performance backbone for various digital applications and services. In the context of new media, Ethernet plays a crucial role in enabling the seamless delivery of multimedia content, such as streaming video, online gaming, and video conferencing, which are integral to many modern communication and entertainment platforms.[^Kizza13ethernet]

Furthermore, Ethernet's reliability and security features make it a preferred choice for businesses and organizations that require robust and secure network infrastructure to support their digital operations, including e-commerce, cloud computing, and enterprise-level applications.[^Tanenbaum11ethernet]
