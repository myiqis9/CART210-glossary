## Deep fakes

- synthetic media
- vary in their form and creation ( text, image, audio, video)
-	automatically synthesized by a machine-learning system.
-	Can manipulate reality

“ for as long as we have been recording the sights and sounds around us, we have been manipulating them”(farid hany)
We are bombarded with manipulated imagery from the humorous to the absurdly unrealistic body images in fashion magazines and Instagram, weaponized in the form of non-consensual pornography, political attack ads, scientific fraud, misrepresentations in the media, and disinformation campaigns design to sow civil unrest and disrupt democratic elections
he most recent development in digital tampering , in the form of automated AI-powered media synthesis and manipulation aka deep fakes
leveraging modern tools in machine learning, computer graphics and computer vision has lowered the skill and time barriers for manipulating content.
While the ability to alter and change and delete content media is not new, the true power of deep fakes is the widespread access to sophisticated technology that previously was only in the hands of Hollywood-style studios and state-sponsored actors, along with the instantaneous and global distribution channels afforded by social media.

## Upside of deep fakes 

Deep fakes don't create new problems so much as make existing problems worse.
Journalism, education, individual rights, democratic systems, and voting protocols have long been vulnerable. Deep fakes might just be the straw that breaks them. And there lies opportunity for repair. 

Often what's been missing is the political will to make the changes and corrections happen. Perhaps these small incursions into our technologies and civic institutions haven't been significant enough to foment a meaningful appetite for reform. Or perhaps lawmakers and the public simply can't get angry about ephemeral and sometimes difficult to describe harms to concepts like due process, data integrity, and collective intelligence that are not felt viscerally. Sometimes we just need a push. And deep fakes make for a memorable bully.

The potential upside of deep fakes is that they might help muster the political will to address the larger, structural problems made worse by the inability to trust what we see and hear. In other words, maybe an effective way to respond to the scourge of deep fakes isn't to target the creation and use of deep fakes themselves, but rather to focus on strengthening the social and political institutions they disrupt. Now would be a good time to focus on institutional inoculation, fortitude, redundancy, and resiliency. Deep fakes are a symptom of deep problems. 

### Education

We should not be training students to take standardized tests and memorize factors and formulae outside of the contexts in which they are meaningful. We should be teaching students (and continue to train ourselves) to evaluate facts, test systems, and challenge accounts by examining alternative perspectives. This isn't about the subjectivity of all stories or the relativity of truth. We are not relativists when it comes to facts and cultural narratives. But we are realists. And what we learn in the study of humanities and law is how stories work to sustain or undermine power. We might as well acknowledge this as one-way deep fakes function and work from within that structure to talk back to them. Stories (fake or not) will never go away. We have to learn how to have the narrative upper hand to produce critical thinkers and win the battle for truth. To students schooled this way, deep fakes may be annoying-they might even be amusing-but they will not be quite as disruptive to our children's hopeful future if education trains them to be curious, collaborative, skeptical, and productive.

### Media 

We don't pay for journalism as much (or at all) anymore. And we can curate our own news by selecting from hundreds of television channels, shows, and radio stations, to attend to the one that confirms our own views and comports with our own politics. As much as we may praise the information floodgate that is the internet, platforms like Facebook and "Twitter... encourage a mind-set antithetical to journalistic inquiry: They prize image over substance and 'cheap dunks' over reasoned debate. In other words, our personalized, networked, firehose news feeds are rich soil for cultivating deep fakes. 
We should collectively encourage and invest in trusted journalism and reestablish institutional norms of authentication and verification-for example, fact checking that requires standards of proof. Newspapers should not be driven to depend on bottom-line driven platforms like Facebook or networks like Google for advertising dollars. Eyeballs demand catchy headlines and lots of photographs. But click bait luring readers to a non-story with lots of pop-up advertisements is a videogame, not news.
We need to commit to investigative journalism and photo journalists whose professionalization as truth seekers and truth tellers are so central to our democracy we protected the press from government interference

### Democratic institutions

Lawmakers could start by better pursuing electoral integrity, which includes ensuring more people vote and their votes count. Increasing the number of voters might help dilute the negative effect a deep fake would produce and have the additional benefit of better ensuring a representative democracy. Political, social, and economic inequality, bred through the alienation of individuals from their communities of support, feeds peoples' receptiveness to disinformation. As Claire Wardle writes, "When humans are angry and fearful, their critical thinking skills diminish." With more participation and enthusiasm for self-government, the benefits of which should begin with those who have the least, the governmental institutions that sustain us will work for us all. And the deep fakes that aim to dismantle them will be outvoted by those who believe and know better.[^upside02deepfakes]

## Regulations of deep fakes

### 1-	Deep fake pornography

**What is it?**

Revenge porn and celebrity deep fakes. Revenge porn refers to sexually explicit material which is created and widely disseminated to humiliate, threaten, or make other harm to a person, who has broken off the relationship. Lately, revenge porn expanded to similar deep fake sex videos where nonconsensual pornographic deep fakes are distributed by hackers or anyone seeking financial gain or notoriety rather than revenge for the lost relations. Another category of deep fake sex content refers to face-swapped celebrity porn where celebrity images are superimposed on the bodies of individuals engaged in sexual acts.
From the ethical and normative perspective, deep fake sex videos first and foremost are seen as a new form of sexual privacy invasion. Sexual privacy serves an invaluable function in the society: it facilitates identity development, intimacy and equality. Furthermore, sexual privacy forms one of the cornerstone pillars of human agency and autonomy. Deep fake sex videos have additional negative ramifications. In particular, revenge porn could oftentimes be one aspect of sexual humiliation and exploitation, physical, mental or financial abuse of individuals. Revenge porn and deep fake sex videos could be witnessed also in corporations as a tool for sexual exploitation or workplace discrimination.

3 major issues in legal practice 

*1.	Difficult to identify the victim.*
Differently from porn videos, deep fake pornography involves three (not two) individuals: the person(s) whose body is truthfully being represented and the person whose face has been added by AI. In either case, none of the individuals concerned had given consent; and therefore both could raise claims in relation to the violation of self-image rights. In jurisdictions where pornography is protected by copyright, authors of the movie may raise claims related to the modification of the video.

*3.	Identification of the wrongdoer*
Is it the person who created the original video, created deep fake, or uploaded it to the site and distributed online? The situations may vary depending on whether the person creating the original and the deep fake video and the person uploading and distributing the deep fake is not the same. Besides, the potential defendant is likely to argue that one cannot sue someone for exposing the intimate details of someone’s life when it is not that person’s personal life that is in fact being exposed.

*4.	Liability problems*
It may be challenging to impose the liability creating, distributing, and storing deep fake sex content. Online platforms hosting such content may be not able or willing to react to the requests to remove the content. Should the court order be necessary? The plaintiff may also face jurisdictional and choice of law hurdles.

### 2-	Deep fakes in political campaigns 

**What is it?**

Deep fakes can have profound negative consequences to democracies: deep-faked news reports could be aimed at targeting the reputation of certain individuals, portray fake events (e.g., faked terrorist attack) or impact such democratic processes as electoral campaigns or other socially significant events. Deep fakes may be used as catalyst to erode trust in political institutions, deepen division among social groups. If used by hostile governments, deep fakes could even pose threats to national security or impair international relations.
The danger of deep fakes is that technology enables one to present to others an alternative reality presenting people saying and doing things they never did, thus deceiving an unaware public. This makes an old age saying seeing is believing no longer valid. The problem with deep fakes is that their impact is hard to measure. In fact statistics showing how many viewers viewed or shared a deep fake may not reveal the real impact to those viewed. Some authors suggest that fake news (including deep fakes) shared on social media tend to have a stronger effect than ordinary political campaigns. Another recent finding suggests that people overestimate their ability to separate the truth from false, that people overestimate political news that are in line with their beliefs and discount news which are contrary to their beliefs. In the post-truth political environment, this translates into the trend of political communication where the crucial concern becomes not what is moral, ethical or factual, but what works.

**Regulations?**

Certain sanctions for disseminating false information could be imposed in criminal laws. However, granting excessive “censorship” rights to administrative agencies could be challenged as an unconstitutional restriction of the freedom of speech. It may be argued that the “market” will be able to react to the realities of fake news in the political sphere. Arguably, politicians whose images are used in creating defamatory or false deep fakes could seek remedies entrenched in tort laws or copyright law. The problem with this argument is that it does not provide efficient remedies to clean-up the detrimental consequences caused by videos that have become viral.

### 3-	Commercial uses of deep fakes 

**What is it?**

Deep fake technology has enormous beneficial potential in commercial applications. Creation of video content will become way cheaper and will undoubtedly facilitate a wave of new business models and also facilitate new forms of communication. One possible unintended consequence could be the emergence of “deep fake data silos” on the internet which control how deep fakes are created or disseminated. Commercial uses of deep fakes are socially beneficial as long as deep fake technologies are used for lawful purposes. There may nonetheless be situations where the content is created without getting the necessary right-holder’s consent. In such cases, the suffering party should be able to rely on the wide array of traditional legal concepts and theories in contract or tort law.

There may nonetheless be situations where the content is created without getting the necessary right-holder’s consent. In such cases, the suffering party should be able to rely on the wide array of traditional legal concepts and theories in contract or tort law. Furthermore, in situations where there is disagreement as to the legal ownership of the new content created using GAN technologies, parties should be able to rely on the existing rules on initial ownership or work-made-for-hire doctrine.

### 4-	Creative deep fakes 

**What is it?**

Deep fake technology opens endless opportunities to use that technology for creative and scientific purposes by students or artists. It could be seen as a medium which facilitates creative interactions, political debates and forms a constitutive part of free speech. One of the unintended consequences of using deep fakes technology in creative or educational setting is that it could lead to bullying among children at schools.

**Regulations?**

From the legal perspective, besides invasion to privacy, a number of other fundamental legal doctrines from contract, tort, or property law could be relevant in disputes concerning the legality of creative deep fakes. In addition, creative deep fakes may lead to certain IP-related controversies. More specifically, from the copyright law perspective, it may be questioned whether the creator of a deep fake could claim copyright authorship of the newly created deep fake or whether the use of the original content (one or multiple copyrighted works) amounts to an infringement of copyright and/or image rights. Furthermore, it may be questioned whether the creator of a deep fake could rely one certain doctrines that would exempt from liability. For instance, in the case of copyright infringement, the creator of a deep fake could invoke statutory exemptions such as parody or satire.[^regulations03deepfakes]
