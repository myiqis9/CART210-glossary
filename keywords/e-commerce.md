## E-commerce
E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, refers to buying and selling goods and services on the internet. It is part of a bigger industry called e-business which includes all the processes that are needed to run an online company.[^Bloomental23ecommerce] Consumers can buy almost everything at any time of the day through ecommerce.[^Forbes23ecommerce]

The history of e-commerce dates back to even before the creation of the Internet. It started with the electronic system called EDI in the 1960s, which allowed document transfers. The first online transaction happened in 1994 when a CD was sold through an online market called NetMarket. Since then, the industry has grown and given rise to today’s popular platforms such as Amazon, eBay, Shopify, etc.[^Bloomental23ecommerce]

E-commerce is related to new media as it has been significantly influenced by the rise of new media, particularly social media. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have emerged as new marketplaces for businesses, facilitating them to broaden their reach and establish a more personal connection with their customers.[^Dwivedi23ecommerce] This fusion of media and commerce, often termed “social commerce,” has redefined the traditional business model and unlocked new possibilities for businesses.[^HuangYu16ecommerce]

Moreover, E-commerce has also transformed marketing strategies. The rise of seamless shopping experiences has pushed marketers to use methods and content types that make the customer’s path to purchase smoother.[^HuangYu16ecommerce] This includes strategies like using video ads on sites like YouTube, working with influencers, and new trends like shopping in a virtual reality setting and live online shopping events.[^HuangYu16ecommerce]
