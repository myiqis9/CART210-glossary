## Multitouch

Multitouch technology allows users to interact with computers via graphical user interfaces, utilizing multiple points of contact at the same time to improve interaction efficiency. Multitouch interfaces, which combine display technology with sensors capable of tracking multiple points of input, provide a more natural and intuitive interaction experience. [^Zare24multitouch1]

Multitouch technology produces an interface that blurs the distinction between virtual and physical reality by reading and responding to numerous simultaneous touches. Using grid technology, it recognizes point groupings rather than single points picked using a mouse, finger, or stylus. [^Zare24multitouch2]

The concept of multitouch technology dates back to 1982, when Nimish Mehta of Toronto University created the first multitouch display using finger pressure. However, its widespread adoption was initially limited by shortages and high costs. The release of Apple's iPhone revolutionized its adoption. [^Zare24multitouch3]

 Apple has prominently used multitouch technology in products such as the iPhone and iPad. Furthermore, multitouch touchpads are popular in laptops, and tablet computers have essentially supplanted traditional stylus input, which is supported by modern operating systems. [^Zare24multitouch4]

Multitouch products use detecting technologies that fall into three categories: sensor arrays, capacitive sensing, and vision-based systems. Sensor arrays are employed in multitouch products to detect and interpret multiple points of contact on a surface, enabling intuitive interaction. Capacitive sensing technology is utilized to detect changes in electrical capacitance caused by touch, allowing for precise and responsive multitouch input. Vision-based systems utilize cameras or other optical sensors to track and interpret hand movements and gestures, enabling touchless interaction with multitouch devices. [^Zare24multitouch5]
