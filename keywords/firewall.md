## Firewall

![Firewall](images/firewall-tran.jpg)

A firewall is like a security gate that controls what comes in and out. It is a [network security](../main/glossary.md#networksecurity) device that monitors the incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block them based on a set of defined security rules. There are different types of firewalls, such as proxy, stateful inspection, UTM, next-generation, cloud-native firewalls and more, each with different features and functions. [^Cisco24firewall]

A firewall has many benefits, such as blocking spyware, stopping virus attacks, promoting privacy, and network traffic, and preventing hackers from accessing the network. [^Spiceworks24firewall]

In the context of new media, firewalls play a crucial role in securing the infrastructure that supports various digital platforms and services. As new media increasingly relies on internet-based technologies, firewalls become essential for protecting against cyber threats, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data, and maintaining the overall security of the digital ecosystem.[^Whitman18firewall]

Firewalls are particularly important for [e-commerce](../main/glossary.md#e-commerce) platforms, where they safeguard the transmission of financial and personal information between customers and businesses. They also protect against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which can disrupt the availability of online services.[^Vacca17firewall]

Furthermore, firewalls are essential for securing cloud-based new media applications, where data and resources are hosted on remote servers. They help to establish a secure perimeter around the cloud infrastructure, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring the privacy and integrity of the data.[^Rittinghouse16firewall]
