## Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational frameworks that mimic the brain's structure consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). These networks, through training, learn to perform tasks by adjusting connections based on input data, improving accuracy over time without explicit task-specific programming. They are fundamental in fields like image recognition, natural language processing, and more, due to their ability to learn from vast amounts of data and identify patterns that are not easily discernible by humans.[^NeuralNetworksHerve] Neural networks are advanced tools for solving specific problems in areas like pattern recognition and data analysis due to their high speed and learning capabilities from examples (training data sets).[^NeuralNetworksBishop]

Overall, Neural network research explores how computers can mimic the brain's way of processing information, moving away from traditional step-by-step computing to more interconnected and simultaneous methods. Researchers are trying to simplify and understand how these brain-like systems can solve complex tasks by focusing on neurons, which are like tiny processing units influenced by their connections' strengths. They also look into how these networks learn and improve through a process called backpropagation.[^BasicIdeasInNeuralNetworks]
