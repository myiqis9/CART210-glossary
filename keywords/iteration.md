## Iteration:
The word iteration generally refers to an instance of a process in which repetition is fundamental. The iteration process aims to exploit repetition to take advantage of the information gathered during each iteration. However, in certain fields such as mathematics, computation and design, the word has acquired more specific meanings for each field. In fact, in various areas comprising product development, such as: design, construction, manufacturing and software (among others), the importance of the iteration process is well-recognised.[^perspectivesOnIteration] below are more specific definitions of *iteration*:
### In Mathematics:
The iteration process is used for equations where obtaining the exact answer is difficult or impossible. The process involves repeatedly calculating approximations of the equation(s) in question, attempting to combine the results of multiple approximative calculations to converge to the solution. In this context, an iteration refers to a single calculation of the iterated equation(s).
### In Computation:
In computation, an iteration usually refers to a complete calculation of a repeatedly executed programmed algorithm. Iterations are fundamental in computing, computers repeatedly run algorithms to execute processes or calculations, each iteration being based on the last.[^OxfordIteration] For example, many physics simulations rely on repeatedly executing physics calculation algorithms, introducing small (simulated) time differences through each iteration, continually updating data and allowing for accurate calculation and display of the simulations.
### In product development or design:
In software development, an iteration refers to a specific software version/build. When developing or designing products, creating prototype iterations is often necessary to find unexpected problems or flaws overlooked during the design phase, in order to improve the next iteration, repeating the process until a satisfactory product is obtained. The beginnings of aviation showcase the importance of iteration in design engineering, “It took the Wright brothers five iterations of the design process to get to the first successful power aircraft.  Each iteration, which took about a year, brought them closer to their final success.  The iterations started with a kite and progressed to gliders. These gliders were successively improved until they could build their famous powered aircraft.  Each iteration also allowed the Wrights to gain valuable experience in learning how to fly”[^wrightBrosIteration].

This aims to showcase the importance of iteration in design, and how failure and improvement are fundamental to this process. Marked in red are failed iterations, in green are functional ones.
