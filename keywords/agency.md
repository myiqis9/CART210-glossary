## Agency 

Agency is the “capacity, condition, or state of acting or of exerting power”. [^MerriamWeb24agency] One’s sense of self-agency - that is the sense that there is an “I” who is generating an action - largely depends on “the degree of discrepancy resulting from comparison between the predicted and actual sensory feedback”. [^Sato05agency] The concept is highly applicable to studies of [human-Computer Interaction](../main/glossary.md#computer-human_interaction).

Agency is felt by degrees: one can feel more or less in control. This variation is particularly clear when a [user](../main/glossary.md#user) interacts with a machine: the feeling of control varies between different operator inputs and expected machine response. 

Often, one may knowingly act with agency and receive the expected result of an act. However, these judgements of agency frequently do not follow actual control in situations where agency might be ambiguous.  [^Sato05agency]

Feminist theory has done a lot of the heavy lifting to develop "agency" as a concept, discussing who in society has agency - the ability to exert power - and who does not, and is therefore not fully human[^Davies91agency] (women, children, the insane, the machine).
