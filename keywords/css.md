## CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
### Definition
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheet, is a language used to style HTML or XML documents. CSS gives developpers and designers the power to change the presentation of a webpage/website [^meyer01css]. They can personnalize everything from fonts, to colors, to the layout [^robbins02css]. More experienced developpers can even play around with the behavior of a page. CSS is usually written independently from the HTML files in a file of type ".css". CSS was created to allow HTML files to be exlusively markup [^g04css].  

There are 3 ways to add CSS to a webpage [^w3school03css]:
1. **External**: CSS is written in an external file and then linked to its respective HTML file with a \<link> tag within the \<head>. Ex:  
\<head>  
\<link rel="stylesheet" href="thecssfile.css">  
\</head>
2. **Internal**: CSS is written just as if it was in a separate file, but directly in the HTML file within a \<style> tag. Ex:  
\<style>  
body {  
  color: black;  
  padding: 0px;  
}  
\</style>
3. **Inline**: CSS properties are written inline with the tag they are directly modifying. This way is usually reserved for properties that need to be prioritized in loading. It is not recommended otherwise as it can reduce code readability. Ex:  
\<body>  
\<p style="color:black; padding:5px;">This is a paragraph.\</p>  
\</body>
