## UX (User Experience)
### Definition

UX, also known as UX design or User Experience, is a concept in the field of human-computer interaction [^yablonski01ux]. UX refers to the the process of designing a product or service that meets a user's needs and provides a meagninful overall experience. The process includes research that  stretches across multiple domains like engineering, marketing, and production teams.

UX designers research the way users interact with and use prodcuts. They need to understand the users' mind in order to understand their needs. They take into account factors such as predispositions, needs, motivation, and mood of the user in order to build the complexity, purpose, usability, accessibility and functionnality of the product [^berni02ux]. They make sure that the product meets the business goals and objectives by outlining the product's abilities and limitations. 

### Differences between UX and UI
| UX                                      | UI                                  |

| Entire process of creation [^idf04ux]               | Focusing on the looks             |
| How does the interaction make them feel | What does the user interact with  |
| Make the purpose of the buttons clear   | Give the buttons an attractive visual |
| User's journey from start to end        | User's interaction with a specific element |
| Easy to use | Easy on the eye

#### Examples
1. Imagine the newest bathrooms at Concordia University where the hand dryer and the faucet are connected in the shape of a T. Now imagine if they were a website. The UI designers did a wonderful job creating a design that seamlessly fits with the rest of the bathroom. It is generally nice to look at. It's usability on the other hand, is lacking. The UX designers failed to take into account that when the dryers turn on, the water in the sink is splashed right back at the user.

### What do they have in common?
UX and UI designers often work together to assure their product's:
- Usability
- Interactivity
- Behavior
- Effortless experience
