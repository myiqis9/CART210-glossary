## Posthuman

![Posthuman](images/posthuman-hoang.jpg)

The posthuman is a broad concept defined by two differing - and at times contradicting - schools of thought: the posthuman as "a category that attempts to capture some future configuration"[^rugo20posthuman] and the posthuman as "a condition."[^rugo20posthuman] 

On one hand, the posthuman is a subject of human enhancement characterized by at least one capacity that transcends human limitations, unaided by modern technology[^bostrom06posthuman]. This view implies the use of advanced technology, genetic manipulation, and biointervention [^cohen21posthuman] to bring to life such 'advancements' to the human being. Swedish philosopher and writer Nick Bostrom outlines three general capabilities that, if achieved at greater heights than human's capabilities, would define the posthuman: health (to maintain physical and mental health), cognition (general intellect and other special faculties), and emotion (to enjoy life and 'properly' respond to life).[^bostrom06posthuman]

On the other hand, the posthuman is also conceived as a critique of humanism, of the centralization of the human amongst non-humans, and of the idea of man as a measure of all things. Unlike the former school of thought, which seeks to further human superiority - viewing the posthuman as "an extension of rational mastery"[^rugo20posthuman], this philosophical framework "promotes horizontal ontologies and expanded ethics."[^rugo20posthuman] 

However, both ends compel self-reflection, positing a need to renew the existing definition of human in relation to other beings, to question what makes up the human body and mind, that is critical to define the future human, the posthuman. Judith Halberstam and Ira Livingston, in defining posthuman bodies, recall Donna Haraway's "one is too few, two is too many" with respect to her cyborg in order to argue that assemblages should priviledge "someness" over our current "mind-body dualism with a heterogeneous monism" in which "someness" isn't a quantity in waiting, but rather threads the line between the numerable and inumerable.[^halberstamLivingston95posthuman] As the relationship between human and non-human - machine, notably - exponentially develops in [cyberspace](../main/glossary.md#cyberspace) thus blurring the lines between the two in a symbiosis, and as the human body and mind become increasingly hybrid, posthuman discourse (from both schools of thought) becomes increasingly pressing.
