## Information Architecture 


Information architecture is an area within the field of library and information science. [^dillon05information_architecture] It is the practice of making information easily accessible and understandable.[^usibility19information_architecture]
Thus, it involves processes such as searching, categorizing, and presenting relevant information to help individuals understand how to access the things that they are looking to find. [^rosenfeld98information_architecture]

Nowadays, the term has become mostly associated with web design as it is quite useful to create a comprehensible and easily navigated website.[^dillon05information_architecture]
But it is important to remember that the fundamental aspects of information architecture can be easily applied to the physical world and not only to the World Wide Web.[^dillon05information_architecture]
For instance, it is put into use in most public spaces such as department stores and museums. We know exactly that we will be able to find our favorite ice cream flavor in the frozen food aisle just as we know that we will find the Egyptian sarcophagi in the wing of the museum that is dedicated to Egyptian art and artifacts.

In the context of creating a website, information architecture is about setting up a framework such that the user has a cohesive, coherent, and consistent experience. 
The word “architecture” is a fitting metaphor because to achieve such an endeavor of creating a sustainable experience for the user—to create the larger picture—it is important to understand underlying factors and the ways in which they relate to each other within these complex multidimensional information spaces.[^rosenfeld98information_architecture]

Information architecture is more and more significant because we live in a world where information is never-ending.[^usibility19information_architecture]
