## GPU
A Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) is a device originally designed to perform rendering for computers to be able to make 3D visual effects on 2D surfaces.[^parker17gpu] Not to be confused with CPU [link], the GPU is tasked to run parallel to it to complete the CPU's tasks with minimum latency. Nowadays, GPU is used in countless industrial applications instead of CPU doing all the work.[^brodtkorb13gpu]

Being officially created by NVIDIA™ Corporation, they made the first ever GPU called the GeForce 256 on August 31, 1999.[^nvidia99gpu] It was a decision that would take months or years to be able to master and do its job as programming the machine would take a lot of effort. 

The GPU is used for graphical rendering, machine learning[link], and video editing programs requiring any mathematical calculations done rapidly (as it is the GPU’s specialty)[^amazongpu]. The GPU is also well to be able to raise the effectiveness of many compute-intensive tasks. GPUs are mostly used for gaming, professional visualization (such as video editing programs, drawing programs, and other types of visualization applications), machine learning, blockchain (such as [NFTs](../main/glossary.md#nft)), and simulations.
