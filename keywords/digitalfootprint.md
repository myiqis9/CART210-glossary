## Digital Footprint

A digital footprint is a trail of data that a user leaves behind as they browse the internet[^coates12digitalfootprint]. This data comes from downloading online files, visiting websites and webpages, sending emails, and submitting information. According to the Canadian Center for Cyber Security, a digital footprint is built both actively and passively. An active digital footprint is done through intentional actions such as accepting cookies, posting things online and filling out forms. A passive digital footprint is left unintentionally, with some websites tracking the user’s IP address without their knowledge[^govcan24digitalfootprint]. This often leads to third parties accessing it[^coates12digitalfootprint]. Many things could make up a person’s digital footprint: their location, their address, their internet usage, their methods of communication, their employment history and much more[^weavergahegan07digitalfootprint]. A digital footprint leaves bits and pieces of someone’s personal information, which could potentially be a threat to their privacy and safety if accessed by someone with harmful intentions such as identity theft. 

A good way to reduce one’s digital footprint is to limit or even refuse website cookies and be weary of dangerous websites or possible phishing scams. It is also recommended to install anti-virus software to prevent data sharing and to use a VPN[^govcan24digitalfootprint].
