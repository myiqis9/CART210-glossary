## Git

Git is a free, [open source](#opensource.md), and dedicated [version control](#version_control.md) and source code management software. It was created in 2005, when a group of volunteers working on the Linux Kernel had to quickly find a new version control system after a conflict happened with their previous source control management providers, BitKeeper. No longer being able to use this system without paying to use it, and with other free-to-use solutions not being able to fit their development needs, they instead created their own system.[^Geeksforgeeks-Git]

One of its main features is its ability to create branches[^Git-Git]; Different versions of the same code that are independant from each other, but still lets you copy the changes made in another branch into your own if needed. Another important feature is the staging state before a commit is fully completed, which allows you to select which changes will be included in a specific commit.
