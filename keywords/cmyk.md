## CMYK

CMYK is a color model used in printing. It is an abbreviation of **C**yan, **M**agenta, **Y**ellow, and **K**ey[^pham07cmyk] (black, which refers to printing plates being keyed or aligned to the black printing plates) which provides a more reliable reproduction of images that RGB cannot provide. It is also used quite a bit thanks to its incredible accuracy that it can hold.[^liu19cmyk] While it is not the most accurate with darker tones (leading it to become lighter in rare cases) it still holds up to be the most accurate.

While it has many uses, the most used ways are in medicine and printing processes. 

For medical use, it is used as an analysis tool as you can adapt the CMYK models for use to find certain stains in the cells. For example, in a study conducted to attempt to be able to find IHC (immunohistochemistry) stains, researchers edited the CMYK model to be able to read better the IHC as well as being able to tell STAT3 levels easier thanks to the better Yellow channel.

For printing, as it’s most common usage. It is used side by side with Pantone as they are the two printing styles that offer the most accurate version of the original image/as the creator intends.[^plumgrove07cmyk] As screens normally use RGB, most software defaults with RGB which makes it so that printers normally turn the image into CMYK for easier printing.
