# Hologram:

A hologram is created using a laser to project a three-dimensional photograph. How a laser can turn a photograph three-dimensional is done by having the object that will be made three-dimensional needs one laser beam to shine through the whole object first. Then another laser beam is projected onto the reflection of the first laser beam, and the point of intersection is then filmed. The film must then be developed and only afterwards, a third laser beam must pass through the film which finally projects a three-dimensional hologram onto a surface. The great thing about holograms from regular films and photographs is that they can be manipulated however possible and yet the original image or film will always be there. This is because all the information from the film or image is stored within the hologram from the object it is reflected from.[^talbot06hologram] Holograms are significantly different from what we know as digitized forms of reality. Holograms are just created through light diffractions which means that it has all the same information stored within it as the original object. Unlike anything that is turned into a digitized format, a lot of information is lost in translation and thus while the product may look as crisp as the original, it will always be a little less real. Holograms are just presented in another format using the light that shines off of an object, thus it can be seen with the naked eye and is merely the original object seen in an alternate way with the help of laser beams.[^elmahaln.d.hologram]

An example of a hologram can be seen in our daily lives in education when holograms are used to teach students if a teacher cannot be present, they can project themselves in front of the class in order for the lesson to continue. Particularly in medicine, another example of hologram usage is when students and even doctors themselves use them to learn more about human anatomy or specific organs on a three-dimensional hologram of the body. They can also learn about medical data and health conditions of different individuals by seeing many different holograms of different bodies reacting differently. Having these three-dimensional settings allows for more physical interaction with these objects, making engagement and immersiveness two of the key factors that allow students to learn better which holograms can help with.[^walker13hologram]
